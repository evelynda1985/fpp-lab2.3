Create a class Prog3. Inside its main method, create float variables to store each of the following numbers:
1.27, 3.881, 9.6
Output to the console the following two values:
1. the sum of the floats as an integer, obtained by casting the sum to type int
2. the sum of the floats as an integer, obtained by rounding the sum to the nearest integer, using the Math.round function

I used:
Prog3 class that includes the main. This class includes a couple of methods to get the desire result.
Test Cases using TDD.

Static word in practice:

A static variable is common to all the instances (or objects) of the
class because it is a class level variable.

Static methods in java belong to the class (not an instance of it). They
use no instance variables and will usually take input from the
parameters, perform actions on it, then return some result.

This project used TDD with Junit test
